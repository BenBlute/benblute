                <h1>A comprehensive guide to web3 wallets</h1>
                <br />

                <p>It’s helpful to understand the inner workings of your wallet software in order to stay safe in the world of web3. In this article, I will explain how wallets work, and how to prevent a malicious actor from getting access to your digital assets.</p>
                <p>IMPORTANT: All private keys, seeds, and seed phrases in this article were randomly generated for the purpose of example. Never share your actual private keys, seeds, or seed phrases with anyone!</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Web3 accounts</h2>
                <p>In order to track ownership of digital assets, blockchains and other distributed ledgers need a way to uniquely identify and authenticate users. Web2 applications often solve this problem with usernames and passwords. Usernames help to keep track of user data, and any request to modify that data must be authenticated with the corresponding password. The problem with this approach is that it requires a centralized database to store passwords privately. All of the data on a distributed ledger is visible to the public, so in order to identify and authenticate users, we need to use a bit of cryptography.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Digital signature algorithms</h2>
                <p>There are many different digital signature algorithms, but the basic terminology remains the same for all of them. I will use ECDSA in this article because it's used by most of the top distributed ledgers, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
                <p>Instead of usernames and passwords, digital signature algorithms use a set of numbers called a keypair. Here is an example of an ECDSA keypair:</p>
                <p>Private key: 0xa45f9af43912fdd5e88c492226be082029f257681d4b3e73b68be535d2fb0526
                <br />
                Public key: 0x3a149f0c5dc5c0f1e29e573215c23710de9c4f87</p>
                <p>These numbers are often written in hexadecimal, which is a numeral system with sixteen digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a, b, c, d, e, f). Hexadecimal numbers are prefixed with 0x to distinguish them from decimal numbers (e.g. 123 and 0x123 represent two different numbers).</p>
                <p>The public key is calculated from the private key using an irreversible function. This gives the keypair the following properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Given a keypair’s private key, it is possible to determine the keypair’s public key</li>
                    <li>Given a keypair’s public key, it is NOT possible to determine the keypair’s private key</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Digital signature algorithms also include a set of functions to create and verify signatures. A digital signature serves the same purpose as a physical signature; it shows that the signer approved of a given message. Here is an example of a signature:</p>
                <p>Message: “This is an example message"
                <br />
                Signature: 0x9e86dccfc582f3614f55a0262897c469abcc5ae8b5847b1376febc2b5c77e54b4ef31b59b5992899aa505778d17d2cf464a67bc57a89f827b5634e775a30d59e</p>
                <p>Signatures have the following properties:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Given a keypair’s private key and a message, it is possible to generate a corresponding signature</li>
                    <li>Given a keypair’s public key, a message, and a signature, it is possible to verify that the signature was generated using the keypair’s private key</li>
                    <li>Given a keypair’s public key, a message, and a signature, it is NOT possible to determine the keypair’s private key</li>
                    <li>Most importantly, it is NOT possible to generate a valid signature without access to the keypair’s private key</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So what does all of this mean? Basically, the public key acts like a username, and the private key acts like a password. Data on a distributed ledger (e.g. token balances) is linked to users with public keys, and any request to modify that data (e.g. token transfers) must be authenticated with the corresponding private keys by generating a signature. The important part is that (unlike passwords) you don’t need to have access to the private key to verify a signature. That makes it possible for the distributed ledger to authenticate users without storing their private keys.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Address checksums</h2>
                <p>A checksum is a way to determine whether or not a piece of data has been modified. Most distributed ledgers include a checksum in their public addresses to safeguard against typos. For example, if you attempt to transfer bitcoin to an address, but mistakenly capitalize a letter that should be lowercase, the checksum will fail and the Bitcoin network will not recognize the transfer as a valid transaction.</p>
                <p>Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum clients don’t enforce an address checksum. This means that the Ethereum network will recognize any 20 digit hexadecimal number as a valid address. However, most wallets and dapps support an application level standard that uses the capitalization of letters in an address as a checksum. For example, 0x3a149f0c5dc5c0f1e29e573215c23710de9c4f87 and 0x3a149f0c5dc5c0F1E29e573215C23710dE9c4f87 both represent the same hexadecimal number, but most applications will not recognize the first one as a valid address because the letters are not capitalized properly.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Hierarchical deterministic wallets</h2>
                <p>Users often create multiple accounts for different purposes. This can help increase security and privacy. In fact, wallets for UTXO based distributed ledgers (e.g. Bitcoin) will often generate a new keypair for every single transaction. Keeping track of a large number of keypairs can be cumbersome, and losing any one of the private keys can result in loss of digital assets. Fortunately, this problem can be solved with hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets.</p>
                <p>HD wallets use a single number, called a seed, to generate an indefinite amount of keypairs. Here is an example of an HD wallet for Ethereum:</p>
                <p>Seed: 0x1059da4e95de6bc08e86d554cb64ea8f4dd92a830a5de24ec4a1127059d7b36118c29fc9c34d914bd0bc1096604b8bfe33b6e30b3aae20d969c23a170f6fe6c2
                <br />
                Keypair 1: 0x3a149f0c5dc5c0f1e29e573215c23710de9c4f87, 0xa45f9af43912fdd5e88c492226be082029f257681d4b3e73b68be535d2fb0526
                <br />
                Keypair 2: 0x9e8a4fd9ba74dbb0c7f465ef56b47489793aa102, 0x6e5ab2a3ae20c7b3a1c0645b03689e88e8cdff16f6a39d6a420bfebc20e8a941
                <br />
                Keypair 3: 0x08eb0646ddc52e12a03215b94b244b674e9d7a0f, 0x938caf07197eda13679bfd88df7e5f6eac3cd9f9248ed445f1a0e084a3e9417c</p>
                <p>Rather than storing all three private keys, the owner of this wallet would only have to store the seed. Using the seed, the wallet software can determine all of the keys associated with the wallet, and access all of its digital assets.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Seed phrases</h2>
                <p>A seed phrase, also known as a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase, is a series of 12 to 24 words that can be converted into a seed. Here is an example of a seed phrase:</p>
                <p>Seed: 0x1059da4e95de6bc08e86d554cb64ea8f4dd92a830a5de24ec4a1127059d7b36118c29fc9c34d914bd0bc1096604b8bfe33b6e30b3aae20d969c23a170f6fe6c2
                <br />
                Seed phrase: bright demand olive glance crater key head glory quantum leisure intact age</p>
                <p>Both of these values can be used to access the exact same set of keypairs, but the seed phrase is much more user-friendly. It also adds some much needed redundancy to the seed. If you mess up a single letter in a seed or seed phrase, it becomes completely invalid. However, with a seed phrase, these mistakes usually result in a misspelled word, which makes them easy to recognize and correct.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Custodial wallets</h2>
                <p>Centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance usually store users' assets on custodial wallets. A custodial wallet is essentially an IOU from another party that manages keypairs on your behalf. This isn’t necessarily a security risk (people have been trusting banks with their money for centuries), but it does defeat the entire point of distributed ledger technology. As the mantra goes, “Not your keys, not your coins.”</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Web3 security</h2>
                <p>Once you’ve taken the step into the world of web3 and transferred your digital assets into a non-custodial wallet, it’s important to understand the various ways in which a malicious actor might try to gain access to your wallet. As a quick review, any transaction that uses your digital assets must be authenticated with a signature. A signature is generated from a private key, which in turn is generated from a seed, which in turn is generated from a seed phrase. If a malicious actor gets hold of any one of these values (your seed phrase, seed, private key, or a malicious signature) they could gain access to your digital assets.</p>
                <p>Most wallet software will encrypt your seed using a password, so the first step to staying secure is using a secure password. I’m not going to go into too much detail because I’m sure you’ve heard it all before. Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, avoid dictionary words, etc. If you want to be extra safe, you can use a hardware wallet, which stores your seed on a separate device that is not connected to the internet.</p>
                <p>Most wallet software will also show you your seed phrase during the setup process. This is meant to be a backup in case something happens to the device your wallet is running on. Avoid storing this seed phrase on a computer. It’s best to write it down on paper and hide it somewhere only you can find it. And most importantly, never share your seed phrase with anyone, for any reason!</p>
                <p>The final way a malicious actor can gain access to your digital assets is by getting you to sign a malicious message or transaction. This is the most difficult type of attack to defend against because it can be very hard to tell the difference between a legitimate signature and a malicious one. The best way to keep yourself safe, without having to understand the inner workings of every smart contract you interact with, is to only sign messages and transactions for reputable applications (e.g. Uniswap or Opensea). Also, beware of websites that imitate reputable applications, which often use similar domain names (e.g. unswap.org instead of uniswap.org). The safest way to open an application is by googling it and clicking on the first result that isn’t marked as an ad.</p>
                <p>Thanks for reading to the end. I hope you learned a thing or two about wallets. Now go and enjoy the wonderful world of web3!</p>
