                <h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>There are far too many projects trying to reinvent the blockchain (Solana, Cardano, Terra, Polkadot, Avalanche, Algorand, etc) and not enough projects using blockchain the way it was meant to be used. I’m going to put extra emphasis on “the way it was meant to be used” because this is where most projects fail. Considering the entire point of blockchain technology is to create decentralized applications, I challenge you to name three applications that you believe to be decentralized. Once you have a list in your head, do a bit of googling to answer the following three questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How is the website hosted? (hint: it’s probably a centralized service like AWS or Google Cloud)</li>
                    <li>How does the website read data from the blockchain? (hint: it’s probably a centralized service like Infura)</li>
                    <li>Do the smart contracts have a single point of failure? (hint: try calling the owner() function on etherscan and check if it’s an externally owned account)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It’s amazing how many applications fail not just one, but all three of these tests. As a proponent of decentralization, I’m tired of seeing so many projects fail at such a fundamental level.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Solon</h2>
                <p>The idea for Solon started as a single ETF, then it turned into an automated market maker, then we added an NFT exchange, and soon we were rebuilding the entire world of decentralized finance. Our goal is not only to create decentralized versions of other applications, but also to improve upon them. I’ll explain how we plan to do that in the sections below.</p>
                <br />

                <h4>Automated maket maker</h4>
                <p>The core of the Solon ecosystem is an automated market maker. It serves as a token exchange and a way for anyone to create their own ETF. Solon AMM is similar to Balancer, in that it allows for the creation of liquidity pools with more than two tokens. However, we improved upon the Balancer protocol in a few ways. First, we allow pool managers to concentrate liquidity to any price range they want. Second, we created a new type of fee which is calculated as a percentage of the maximum amount of impermanent loss that can be caused by a swap. When set to 100%, this fee will completely eliminate the risk of impermanent loss.</p>
                <br />

                <h4>NFT exchange</h4>
                <p>The main selling points of the Solon NFT exchange are rentable and fractional NFTs. Rentable NFTs open up the NFT market to many more real world use cases (like real estate) and they allow anyone to make a passive income off of their NFTs. Fractional NFTs make it possible to invest in any NFT project, regardless of its floor price. They also allow liquidity pools to invest in NFTs. Finally, Solon doesn’t charge any protocol fees on the NFT exchange. This allows artists to charge higher fees while still being cheaper for traders.</p>
                <br />

                <h4>Hardware wallet</h4>
                <p>The Solon hardware wallet gives you access to the entire Solon ecosystem through one device. You no longer have to go back and forth between your browser, your wallet software, and your hardware wallet. This will make it possible for anyone to trade cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital assets easily and securely, without any prior knowledge about DeFi. You can even swipe your credit card to buy digital assets with fiat currency.</p>
                <br />

                <h4>DAOs</h4>
                <p>There are far too many projects that claim to have a DAO when, in reality, they don’t. A true DAO is run entirely by smart contracts. No single person (or even a multisig wallet) should have complete control over the assets or smart contracts owned by a DAO. To fix this problem, Solon allows anyone to create a decentralized and autonomous DAO around any token or NFT collection with just a few clicks. We hope this feature will finally put an end to fake DAOs.</p>
                <br />

                <h2>Future plans</h2>
                <p>Max and I have tons of ideas that we couldn't possibly fit into the initial release of Solon. However, as soon as the audit is complete, we plan to enter the waiting list for another audit so we can immediately start work on more dapps. With the token, governance system, and initial marketing out of the way, we will be free to spend all of our time improving and adding to the Solon ecosystem. Here are some of the ideas we've considered:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An algorithmic stablecoin</li>
                    <li>A decentralized social media platform</li>
                    <li>A decentralized freelance platform</li>
                </ul>
                <br />

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>A project is only as decentralized as its weakest link. Even if the only centralized part of an application is its website, someone could easily use that to steal users' funds. Unfortunately, most people don’t have the time to research every aspect of every application they use. That’s why Solon plans to bring the entire world of decentralized finance under one, fully audited, and truly decentralized ecosystem. We believe Solon is the last step needed to bring DeFi to the general public.</p>
